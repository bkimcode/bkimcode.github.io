## The importance of asking smart questions

Asking a smart question can be the difference between receiving helpful answers that further your knowledge, and receiving rude answers or no answers at all. With the insane volume of questions that get posted online, it's important to think about who you're asking your question to, and the details of the question. For example, if you have a question about literature and decide to ask it on stackoverflow, your question will probably either be immedeately flagged/closed or responded to negatively. The reason for this being that stackoverflow is designated as a place to discuss topics relating to programming, which means that the people looking to answer questions, are looking to answer those pertaining to programming. Along with using the right platform, you should also make sure you've taken the correct steps before asking questions on the specific platform. Providing limited information, or not doing the right research before asking your question could lead to you being labelled as a Luser.
