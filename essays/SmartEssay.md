## The importance of asking smart questions

Asking a smart question can be the difference between receiving helpful answers that further your knowledge, and receiving rude answers or no answers at all. With the insane volume of questions that get posted online, it's important to think about who you're asking your question to, and the details of the question. For example, if you have a question about literature and decide to ask it on stackoverflow, your question will probably either be immedeately flagged/closed or responded to negatively. The reason for this being that stackoverflow is designated as a place to discuss topics relating to programming, which means that people looking to answer questions, are looking to answer questions pertaining to programming. Along with using the right platform, being sufficiently informed on the topic of the question can allow you to specify what you need help with. Providing limited information, or not doing the right research before asking your question could lead to you being labelled as a Luser. 

## Example of a Luser

Even if you are well intentioned, if you put no effort into the question you are asking, the people answering will put no little to no effort in providing a answer. An example of this can be seen on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73655156/hello-guys-please-i-need-some-help-from-someone) stackoverflow question where the user is asking:
```
Question: hello guys, please i need some help from someone? [closed]

Execution failed for task ':arcore_flutter_plugin:compileDebugKotlin'. Compilation error. See log for more details 
Closed. This question needs debugging details. It is not currently accepting answers.
Edit the question to include desired behavior, a specific problem or error, and the shortest code necessary to reproduce the problem. This will help others answer the question.

your question title should be something that will tell people who see it what your question is about. â€“

As you can see in this example the user who posts the question is quite polite in his request, but nonetheless because he provide little to no information on what the problem he's having with the only details being the compiler error message, his post has gotten flagged and closed. Stackoverflow has become much more lax over the years, but at the bare minimum you should still atleast provide what you're trying to do/expected results, what os/language you're using, the source code for the segment you are working with, what you have tried and looked into using.
