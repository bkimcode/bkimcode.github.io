## Overview

*The Problem:* Students are almost always forced to fully communicate externally depending on the requests or issues that they have. In a sense, this either restricts students to their known organizations or extends students to mass external websites that may pose security or physical threats. 

*The Solution:* By implementing an app permitting only individuals within the UH System, it ensures better familiarity, security, and openness in advertisement. Doing so would result in a more comfortable and approachable environment without the fears of security or authenticity that external websites may include, nor the limited networking that may be included if advertising was done solo. Due to the nature of inclusion within the UH System, our app would also extend to organizations, instructors, connected alumni, and of course students.

## Approach

Once the User has been verified, the User can access their profile which displays their current listings, look at all listings, report inappropriate listings, and edit their current listings. 

Mockup Page Ideas:
- Landing page 
- Verification page
- User profile (List items that are associated with the user)
- Post a listing form 
- Report a listing page
- List of all items / services posted
- Edit User items/services page

## Use case ideas

- User goes to landing page if the user has not been verified, redirects to verification page
- User goes to landing page, User is verified and is redirected to user profile, User goes to list all of items/services and views list of all items/services
- User goes to landing page, User is verified and redirected to user profile, User goes to edit items/services, edits listed items/services
- User goes to landing page, User is verified and redirected to user profile, User goes to list of all items/services sees an inappropriate posting, User goes to report page, User reports listing. 

## Beyond the basics

- Implement a ban/lockout feature for users that maliciously post or are hacked.
- Implement asynchronous updating
