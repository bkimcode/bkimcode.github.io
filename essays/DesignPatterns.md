## Coding from scratch can be difficult

If you've ever had the experience of developing a website using pure html you will know that it can get messy and be extremely tedious. But UI-Frameworks like

## Impact of coding standards in collaborative work

If you've never understood the importance of coding standards, a surefire way for you to understand would be to get involved in a collaborative programming project. Coding standards allow users to understand eachothers codes more easily. It might seem like a hassle having to add comments to certain methods/functions, or having to use proper spacing, or following naming convetions. But if you're working on a project with someone, these rules allow your partner to quickly understand what you're doing and vice versa. I've personally worked with individuals that never comment anything and when you run into issues, it takes so much unnecesary time to solve them because you have to manually trace every step of what they wrote just to get a slight glimpse of what might be causing the problem. 

## When coding standards were required for your code to run

When you're stuck working with in a unix environment and have to write code in ANSI C, if you don't follow rules such as initializing variables before assigning them values, or have leveled curly braces your code will not run. Navigating through your code using a shell text editor like nano or pico is extremely infuriating if you don't have braces leveled. Although these rules might seem super annoying to follow at first, if you look at why they were implemented it does make sense. For example, in the case of initializing variables before assigning values to them, it seems very redundant to do that now because many modern programming languages do both functions on the same line, it really does take 2 steps: create the variable, assign value to it.
