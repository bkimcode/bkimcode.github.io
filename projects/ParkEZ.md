Finding parking on campus can be extremely inconvenient and frustrating, especially when there are no ways to know whether or not a particular lot is full. This can lead to students spending unnecessary time searching through lots that may already be full which can lead to students arriving late to class. 

Through the Park-EZ app, students will be able to easily identify whether certain lots are full and even get recommendations for areas to park by taking into consideration their destination. This will be done by transmitting data from sensors placed on each parking stall in student lots that detect if a car is parked in a spot, and for how long.

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
